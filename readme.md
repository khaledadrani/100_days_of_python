# day1: binary to decimal


# day2: hexa decimal binary, 

## issues

## epics
first need to rework the code of functions

* first regulate all converters!!!!
* decimal binary hexa octal 
* data structures (dict for memory and registers probably)
*  processor? a class yes POO

* re write code as a library!

# day6: Intermediate Python 

* itertools: cartesian product, permutations, combinations, combinations_with_replacement,accumulate, groupby, count, repeat, cycle
* JSON: load, loads, dump
* Exceptions: predefined, raise, custom
* lambda: basics, map, reduce, filter

# day7: Intermediate Python

# day9: Intermediate Python

* Function arguments: positional args, keywords args, force keywords args, *args, **kwargs
* Function scope: global var, local var, object reference, mutable vs immutable objects!
* Asterik Operator: power, generate list/strings with repetition, args, kwargs, unpacking, merging, create lists and dicts using previous lists and dicts
* Context managers: With, define as class, contextlib.contextmanager decorator, handle exceptions, resources


# day10: Unit testing

* Unit Testing Your Code with the unittest Module: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI
